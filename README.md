# Particle Animation and Modal Interaction

## Description
This project utilizes the particles.js library to create a visually engaging particle animation on the webpage, along with a dynamic modal for displaying additional content. The particle animation features colorful particles that interact subtly, while the modal can show context-sensitive information triggered by user interactions. This code enhances user experience with aesthetic visuals and interactive elements.

## Features

### Particle Animation:
50 particles are generated in random colors (customizable)
Particles are circular, with an opacity of 0.6 and random sizes (customizable)
Lines connect the particles, creating a network effect.
The animation is retina-detectable, ensuring quality on high-resolution displays.

### Navbar Animation:
Text elements animate on page load, enhancing visual appeal.
A typing animation effect is achieved using CSS classes.

### Dynamic Modal:
A modal that opens to display title and content when triggered.
Data attributes (data-title and data-content) are used to populate modal content dynamically based on user interactions.

Customize the particle settings and modal content as desired.

Dependencies
particles.js: Ensure to include this library in your project.
Bootstrap (optional for modal styling): If using Bootstrap for modals, include the Bootstrap CSS and JS files.
